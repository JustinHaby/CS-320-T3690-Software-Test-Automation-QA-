How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Software testing the program can be divided into small parts, each unit has some small portion of code, this code can be tested by unit, as it can help you find bugs in software and make sure the same bugs don't cause the application to break or cause any unscary errors. Overall ensuring that the quality of the code is clear, simple, well tested, bug-free will generate technical sound code.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
My approach was carried out by initiating the assignment as early as possible; this can relate to a professional standpoint. Carefully reading and noting the customers' strict requirements within the overall application was crucial to creating the initial build. Thus, checking the application's functionality based on the clients' requirements.

How do I approach designing software?
There are multiple ways to approach designing software. With the use of coverage tools within Eclipse, you can identify what areas of the project need more attention. Still, it doesn't mean that sites with good coverage shouldn't need more attention. I was introduced to the overall complexity of this topic with the graphs presented throughout the J unit classes. For example, when the test runs smoothly, the chart shows green, and when the test fails, it turns red. This is very beneficial as it can ensure that code is more reliable and error-free. With this, I covered 90% of my code in Junit test cases and generated the desired outcome for both applications.
